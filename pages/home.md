    column1: "After years providing research findings and reporting to our clients, we realized that it was useless: there were some comes and goes between teams and stake holders, some thoughtful comments, and then the data was buried and forgotten. Why? Because no data-driven strategy had been elaborated, nobody in the company was especially entitled or trained to make decisions and take specific action based on data. In the best scenario, it was a “data changed, do something” panic situation, a common pattern nowadays, with web sites traffic, marketing campaigns or sales funnels. 
    On the other hand, we’ve seen medium size companies wasting fortunes in complex data-driven marketing automations that would finally generate a couple of hundred dollars in sales."
    column2: "At Data2Action, we consider there is no “graal” for actionable data: no machine learning algorithm, no generic big data hidden value. We believe in a case by case approach combining human analysis of a data context and machine Learning, that will lead to knowledge convertible - or not - into actions."
